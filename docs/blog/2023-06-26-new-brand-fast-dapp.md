# Features

While we are still in alpha, a lot of features are already there:
* Support for ENS names in templates
* Rendering/working with event logs
* Custom HTML render for events and contract reads
* Better syntax highlighting in the editor
* Starting to ingest events if we go for the analytics feature on the roadmap
* Added Daisy UI (you can add modals, accordeons and more in your apps)
* Added Moment (you can display dates easily or countdowns..)


# Dapp you can try

We worked on the following apps for you to use, learn and remix:
* [Nouns DAO auction page](https://fastdapp.xyz/app/nouns)
* [No Shit Sherlock game](https://fastdapp.xyz/app/no_shit_sherlock)

You can explore the code of those apps and other examples [here](https://github.com/verynifty/fastdapp/tree/main/examples).
