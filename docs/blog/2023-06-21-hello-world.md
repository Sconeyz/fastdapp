A brief introduction of the alpha...

Muse BUILD gives builders super powers to publish magical dapps. Your smart contract is deployed and you need a user interface? Write simple HTML or Markdown and leverage a collection of components. No need to setup a dev environment, RPC provider, server... Just edit your app on Muse BUILD and publish it.
