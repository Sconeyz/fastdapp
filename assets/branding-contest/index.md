## Hammermann 1: Race

This logotype was inspired by the checkered flag of racing sports. It indicates speed and victory. I thought it’d be a nice representative of Fastdapp as it does speed up the process of creating a frontend for dapps.

About the color choice, I think generally the brand is at a stage that can tell any story that it wants to its audience. I choose orange for this submission to convery boldness and excitement. I think the combination of orange and black does a good job at creating a daring personality that also serves modernity with the typeface.

## Hammermann 2: F

a try to make a more edgy character for the brand. The logotype includes a minimalistic and abstract letter F with sharp edges and slopes to provoke professionalism and modernity.

The color choice for this submission was coral red to make the personality more daring.

## Hammermann 3: Arrows

The logo for the third submission I worked on was inspired by the fast-forward button that we’ve all seen in media and music players. It’s meant to convey the idea that you can basically fast forward the process of creating your dapps using fastdapp.

I tried going a different route with the color in this submission and I chose clear blue theme to indicate trust and stability.

## RadDegen

Inspired by the swift and agile Hermes, the Greek god of speed, the web3 branding concept for FastDapp embraces the essence of velocity and efficiency. Just as Hermes’ wings allowed him to move swiftly between realms, FastDapp empowers developers to soar beyond the boundaries of traditional front-end development.

The concept draws upon the symbolism of wings, representing the freedom and speed associated with Hermes. These wings serve as a visual reminder of the incredible speed that FastDapp brings to the table. By providing a seamless front-end tool for building fast interfaces for dApps, FastDapp enables developers to focus their energy and creativity on the core of their projects—the smart contract logic.
